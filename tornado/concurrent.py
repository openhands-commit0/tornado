"""Utilities for working with ``Future`` objects.

Tornado previously provided its own ``Future`` class, but now uses
`asyncio.Future`. This module contains utility functions for working
with `asyncio.Future` in a way that is backwards-compatible with
Tornado's old ``Future`` implementation.

While this module is an important part of Tornado's internal
implementation, applications rarely need to interact with it
directly.

    Returns a future.

    The executor to be used is determined by the ``executor``
    attributes of ``self``. To use a different attribute name, pass a
    keyword argument to the decorator::

        @run_on_executor(executor='_thread_pool')
        def foo(self):
            pass

    This decorator should not be confused with the similarly-named
    `.IOLoop.run_in_executor`. In general, using ``run_in_executor``
    when *calling* a blocking method is recommended instead of using
    this decorator when *defining* a method. If compatibility with older
    versions of Tornado is required, consider defining an executor
    and using ``executor.submit()`` at the call site.

    .. versionchanged:: 4.2
       Added keyword arguments to use alternative attributes.

    .. versionchanged:: 5.0
       Always uses the current IOLoop instead of ``self.io_loop``.

    .. versionchanged:: 5.1
       Returns a `.Future` compatible with ``await`` instead of a
       `concurrent.futures.Future`.

    .. deprecated:: 5.1

       The ``callback`` argument is deprecated and will be removed in
       6.0. The decorator itself is discouraged in new code but will
       not be removed in 6.0.
