"""Implementation of the WebSocket protocol.

`WebSockets <http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/>`_ allow for bidirectional
communication between the browser and server. WebSockets are supported in the
current versions of all major browsers.

This module implements the final version of the WebSocket protocol as
defined in `RFC 6455 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455>`_.

.. versionchanged:: 4.0
   Removed support for the draft 76 protocol version.

class WebSocketHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    """Subclass this class to create a basic WebSocket handler.

    Override `on_message` to handle incoming messages, and use
    `write_message` to send messages to the client. You can also
    override `open` and `on_close` to handle opened and closed
    connections.

    Custom upgrade response headers can be sent by overriding
    `~tornado.web.RequestHandler.set_default_headers` or
    `~tornado.web.RequestHandler.prepare`.

    See http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/ for details on the
    JavaScript interface.  The protocol is specified at
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455.

    Here is an example WebSocket handler that echos back all received messages
    back to the client:

    .. testcode::

      class EchoWebSocket(tornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler):
          def open(self):
              print("WebSocket opened")

          def on_message(self, message):
              self.write_message(u"You said: " + message)

          def on_close(self):
              print("WebSocket closed")

    .. testoutput::
       :hide:

    WebSockets are not standard HTTP connections. The "handshake" is
    HTTP, but after the handshake, the protocol is
    message-based. Consequently, most of the Tornado HTTP facilities
    are not available in handlers of this type. The only communication
    methods available to you are `write_message()`, `ping()`, and
    `close()`. Likewise, your request handler class should implement
    `open()` method rather than ``get()`` or ``post()``.

    If you map the handler above to ``/websocket`` in your application, you can
    invoke it in JavaScript with::

      var ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8888/websocket");
      ws.onopen = function() {
         ws.send("Hello, world");
      };
      ws.onmessage = function (evt) {
         alert(evt.data);
      };

    This script pops up an alert box that says "You said: Hello, world".

    Web browsers allow any site to open a websocket connection to any other,
    instead of using the same-origin policy that governs other network
    access from JavaScript.  This can be surprising and is a potential
    security hole, so since Tornado 4.0 `WebSocketHandler` requires
    applications that wish to receive cross-origin websockets to opt in
    by overriding the `~WebSocketHandler.check_origin` method (see that
    method's docs for details).  Failure to do so is the most likely
    cause of 403 errors when making a websocket connection.

    When using a secure websocket connection (``wss://``) with a self-signed
    certificate, the connection from a browser may fail because it wants
    to show the "accept this certificate" dialog but has nowhere to show it.
    You must first visit a regular HTML page using the same certificate
    to accept it before the websocket connection will succeed.

    If the application setting ``websocket_ping_interval`` has a non-zero
    value, a ping will be sent periodically, and the connection will be
    closed if a response is not received before the ``websocket_ping_timeout``.

    Messages larger than the ``websocket_max_message_size`` application setting
    (default 10MiB) will not be accepted.

    .. versionchanged:: 4.5
       Added ``websocket_ping_interval``, ``websocket_ping_timeout``, and
       ``websocket_max_message_size``.
