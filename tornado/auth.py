"""This module contains implementations of various third-party
authentication schemes.

All the classes in this file are class mixins designed to be used with
the `tornado.web.RequestHandler` class.  They are used in two ways:

* On a login handler, use methods such as ``authenticate_redirect()``,
  ``authorize_redirect()``, and ``get_authenticated_user()`` to
  establish the user's identity and store authentication tokens to your
  database and/or cookies.
* In non-login handlers, use methods such as ``facebook_request()``
  or ``twitter_request()`` to use the authentication tokens to make
  requests to the respective services.

They all take slightly different arguments due to the fact all these
services implement authentication and authorization slightly differently.
See the individual service classes below for complete documentation.

Example usage for Google OAuth:

        * ``session_expires``, an integer encoded as a string representing
          the time until the access token expires in seconds. This field should
          be used like ``int(user['session_expires'])``; in a future version of
          Tornado it will change from a string to an integer.

          ``link``, plus any fields named in the ``extra_fields`` argument. These
