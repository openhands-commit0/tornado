    In this implementation, we partition the addresses by family, and
    make the first connection attempt to whichever address was
    returned first by ``getaddrinfo``.  If that connection fails or
    times out, we begin a connection in parallel to the first address
    of the other family.  If there are additional failures we retry
    with other addresses, keeping one connection attempt per family
    in flight at a time.
