class AsyncTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    """`~unittest.TestCase` subclass for testing `.IOLoop`-based
    asynchronous code.

    The unittest framework is synchronous, so the test must be
    complete by the time the test method returns. This means that
    asynchronous code cannot be used in quite the same way as usual
    and must be adapted to fit. To write your tests with coroutines,
    decorate your test methods with `tornado.testing.gen_test` instead
    of `tornado.gen.coroutine`.

    This class also provides the (deprecated) `stop()` and `wait()`
    methods for a more manual style of testing. The test method itself
    must call ``self.wait()``, and asynchronous callbacks should call
    ``self.stop()`` to signal completion.

    By default, a new `.IOLoop` is constructed for each test and is available
    as ``self.io_loop``.  If the code being tested requires a
    reused global `.IOLoop`, subclasses should override `get_new_ioloop` to return it,
    although this is deprecated as of Tornado 6.3.

    The `.IOLoop`'s ``start`` and ``stop`` methods should not be
    called directly.  Instead, use `self.stop <stop>` and `self.wait
    <wait>`.  Arguments passed to ``self.stop`` are returned from
    ``self.wait``.  It is possible to have multiple ``wait``/``stop``
    cycles in the same test.

    Example::

        # This test uses coroutine style.
        class MyTestCase(AsyncTestCase):
            @tornado.testing.gen_test
            def test_http_fetch(self):

    Tests will typically use the provided ``self.http_client`` to fetch
    URLs from this server.

    Example, assuming the "Hello, world" example from the user guide is in
    ``hello.py``::

        import hello
